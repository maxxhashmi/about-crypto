# Crypto, As I Learned It

All about my take on Crypto : from my very first encounters, to
understanding and actually using Crypto, including trading and
investing strategies.

This may be a local discussion focused on the Philippines, but most
of the concepts here apply broadly to Crypto in general.

This is not meant to be a step-by-step guide or financial advice,
but a personal record of lessons, mistakes, and realizations
gathered along the way while navigating the Crypto space.

## My First Encounters

Way back then, when I first heard about Bitcoin and Crypto, my
initial thought was that it had something to do with cryptography.
Well, in those times, the shortened term “Crypto” was 
more closely associated with cryptography: encryption, security, 
and complex algorithms, rather than currencies or assets. 
These days, however, Crypto almost always refers to Cryptocurrency.

At the time, tech YouTubers talked a lot about these topics, people
like TechLead and JomaTech. Even if they were not my main content
targets, I absorbed bits and pieces of information. All I really
understood back then was that people could gain money through
trading, much like earning interest when someone owes you.

As a Dev, I find it similar when we want to learn coding or 
a new Tech Stack. At first it's very vague, fragmented 
knowledge that later on, would make sense. So, I guess that helped
me dealing with Crypto.

Then in 2025, just this December, I decided to finally take learning
Crypto seriously. I realized that, fortunately, in the Philippines
there are local and approved platforms available. At the same time,
there were also restrictions, such as the banning of Binance in
2024.

This mix of accessibility and limitation turned out to be both good
and bad, something I will tackle later in this write-up.

## High Risk, High Reward

First of all, it should be clear that gaining significant money is
not possible without taking proportionate risk.

If that were not the case, everyone could simply work for a short
time, put money into trading or investing, and earn easily. That
kind of system would not make sense, because money only has value
when it is scarce and tied to effort and risk.

So for those who are uncomfortable with the idea of losing money,
it is better to think twice before entering Crypto, or at least
accept this reality from the start.

Another thing that often gets overlooked is not just *whether* you
put money into Crypto, but *how much* you put in. Small amounts can
still grow, but the impact is usually limited. For example, if I put
10K PHP into Bitcoin and it gains 10 percent, that is only 1K
PHP, roughly a day’s work for many office jobs.

In Metro Manila, even a relatively cheap studio-type apartment can
cost around 8K to 10K PHP per month. To reach that level of
impact from a 10 percent gain, the base capital would already need
to be closer to 100K PHP. In the end, how much risk and capital
to commit is a personal decision, and the expectations should match
the size of the investment / trading.

Also, for those who are looking for something closer to a gambling
experience ( yes, the thrill ! ) but do not want to deal with actual
gambling, Crypto can fill that role. This usually happens
with highly hyped and very volatile coins.

In these cases, some people choose to treat them as entertainment
rather than investment, watching price movements and entering with
amounts they are fully prepared to lose. As long as this is done with
clear limits and expectations, it becomes more about controlled
risk-taking than blind speculation. Gamble responsibly !

## The Tools Needed

When I started using Maya PH Banking and GCash, I noticed that both
already offered Crypto services. This made my curiosity grow even
more, and I initially wanted to put money in right away. However,
before doing that, I searched first, particularly on Reddit, to
read about other Pinoys’ experiences.

What I learned early on was that these tools are called Exchanges.
They are platforms where you buy, sell, and convert Crypto. Without
exchanges, it is difficult to actually transact or move value.

From those discussions, I also saw that some platforms were often
considered unreliable, and that better options were frequently
recommended, such as PDAX and Coins.ph. Others also mentioned using
Binance and similar platforms through VPNs.

## International or Local Exchanges

As mentioned earlier, restricting international exchanges comes
with both good and bad outcomes. On one hand, this means complying
with Philippine government regulations, which many people on
Reddit strongly dislike. After all, one of the original ideas
behind Crypto is to operate independently of government control.

On the other hand, regulation also brings certain protections.
Locally regulated exchanges are secured under the BSP, which
means that if something goes wrong, there is at least a higher
chance of recovering funds. This is similar to how registered
digital banks and e-wallets operate in the Philippines.

So in reality, Crypto as a purely decentralized system did not
fully play out, even on a global scale. We see major platforms
like Binance being banned or regulated in many countries.

That said, some parts of Crypto remain truly decentralized. The
blockchain itself does not depend on any single authority, and if
you really want to, you can still hold your own money without
relying on exchanges or intermediaries.

## Trading Strats

My approach to trading is closer to swing trading rather than
short-term scalping.

For Bitcoin, I usually place a sell limit order once it gains around
8 to 10 percent. For Ethereum, the target is slightly higher, around
15 to 17 percent. With Solana, which is more volatile, I aim for
around 20 to 25 percent gains.

I also do not sell everything at once. Most of the time, I only sell
a portion, usually around 20 to 25 percent, while keeping the rest
of the position intact. This allows me to lock in some profit without
fully exiting the trade.

When it comes to stop losses, I only apply them to Solana. If the
price dips hard, around 25 percent or more, I sell only the same
portion instead of closing the entire position. This helps manage
risk while still staying exposed in case of a recovery.

| Asset   | Profit Target | Portion Sold | Stop Loss Used |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Bitcoin | 8–10%         | 20–25%       | No             |
| Ethereum| 15–17%        | 20–25%       | No             |
| Solana  | 20–25%        | 20–25%       | Yes            |

## Coins Pro

One feature of Coins.ph is Coins Pro, which works similarly to most
major exchanges.

Here, even buying can be done through limit orders, giving you more
control over the price compared to simple market buys.

For deeper transactions and stablecoins, using a limit order when
buying does not always make a significant difference. However, the
option becomes more useful when dealing with volatile assets.

That said, Coins Pro is not basic at all. Using it properly requires
learning how exchanges work, including order types, pricing, and
market behavior.

At this level, you start seeing concepts like order books, bid and
ask prices, and spreads. This is also where trading begins to feel
less like a simple app feature and more like an actual market.

## Fees, Spread, and the Hidden Costs

With Coins Pro, you gain more control compared to simple buy and sell
options, but this also exposes costs that are not always obvious at
first glance.

Aside from trading fees, there is the spread — the difference between
the buy and sell price. Even if fees look small, spreads can quietly
eat into profits, especially when trading frequently or with small
amounts.

These hidden costs become more noticeable in low-liquidity pairs,
where prices move more easily and orders may not fill at the expected
levels. This is why buying and selling can sometimes feel unfair, even
when the market itself is functioning normally.

Understanding fees and spreads is important because they affect
results over time. In Crypto, it is often not just about being right
on direction, but also about managing these small costs that add up.

| Cost Type | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Trading Fee | Fee per executed trade | Reduces profit on every entry and exit |
| Spread | Difference between buy and sell price | Hidden cost, especially on small trades |
| Slippage | Price change during execution | Common in low-liquidity pairs |
| Liquidity | How easily trades are filled | Low liquidity increases spread and slippage |

## Investing

When it comes to investing, we know that Bitcoin and Ethereum are the
core assets.

Bitcoin tends to follow a rough four-year cycle, while Ethereum often
moves with broader market trends and ecosystem growth.

In investing, I consider day-to-day price movements as mostly noise.
My positions are based on long-term conviction rather than short-term
fluctuations.

Because of this, I use Bitcoin and Ethereum in both trading and
investing, so these two major coins serve two different purposes
for me.

To properly separate them, I do not keep long-term holdings on
Coins.ph. Instead, I move them to hot wallets or cold wallets for
storage.

## Investing Proper Storage

As mentioned above, in investing, buying is only 
the first step. After that, proper storage becomes 
just as important. This is where hot wallets and
cold wallets come into play.

Hot wallets are usually connected to the internet and are more
convenient for frequent access. Cold wallets, on the other hand,
are kept offline and are mainly used for long-term storage.

Fortunately, in the Philippines, there is already a reliable local
distributor of Ledger, which makes using a hardware wallet more
accessible.

Some tips I often see from other Pinoys include using an old phone
dedicated only to Crypto, or being extremely careful with manual
storage of recovery phrases. These may sound simple, but they go a
long way in reducing unnecessary risk.

## Parking Money

One thing I found cool was the idea of putting money into Crypto
without actively trading. It's like I have money but on Crypto !

My first choice was to buy USDC ( because I use USDT for trading )
and leave it untouched. When the time
comes, I can sell it back to pesos if the peso loses value, for
example from 59 PHP to 65 PHP. In that sense, it feels similar to
long-term Forex exposure.

The downside is that the gains are not that significant. In many
cases, a traditional time deposit can still outperform this
strategy.

Because of that, I also looked into launchpools and reward programs.
For example, holding PHPC can earn around 3 percent annually, and I
often hear that rates used to be as high as 8 percent before.

Then I encountered Tether Gold ! Even in 2025, it performed very well,
with gains reported at more than 50 percent. This was not due to hype
or a pump, but because it closely tracks the real value of gold. In a
way, this addressed my need for a more stable, commodity-backed
option.

I do hope that more commodities become successfully pegged to coins
in the future. For now, what we mostly have are stablecoins, Tether
Gold, and silver-backed tokens, although silver still suffers from
low liquidity.

| Option | Purpose | Risk Level |
|------|--------|------------|
| USDC or USDT | Preserve value vs PHP | Low |
| PHPC Rewards | Earn modest yield | Low to medium |
| Tether Gold | Commodity exposure | Medium |

## Liquidity in PH Trading

Based on my experience using Coins.ph, trading pairs in PHP are the most
numerous and the most commonly traded. These are followed by USDT
pairs, which are available for fewer assets, and lastly USDC pairs,
which have the least coverage on the platform.

Unfortunately, Tether Gold is still not paired with USDT. Because of
this, liquidity remains limited compared to major stablecoin pairs.
I actually suggested this pairing to Coins.ph Support, but they said
that this is not something they are planning to implement at this
time.

Pairing Tether Gold with USDT would, in my opinion, significantly
improve liquidity and make it more practical to trade within the
platform.

## My Personal Rules

From all of these learnings, I ended up with a few simple rules
that guide how I use and enjoy Crypto.

- for trading, I only use money I am prepared to lose
- for investing, I only commit money I do not need in the near term
  and can hold through volatility
- treat trading as a tool, not a guaranteed source of income
- never chase pumps or sudden hype, no matter how tempting
  unless you want gamble-style fun
- I sell in portions and avoid going all in or all out
- I respect volatility and never assume the market owes me profits
- I prioritize liquidity, especially when dealing with local
  platforms in the Philippines
- I do not overtrade; sometimes doing nothing is the best move
- I separate long-term investing from short-term trading
- I take security seriously and never rush wallet-related actions
- I assume every link, message, and offer could be a scam
- I stay realistic with yields and avoid anything that sounds
  too good to be true

enjoy Crypto as fun and earning !
